# 8-puzzle-A-algorithm

Language used : Java

NOTE: For a* algorithm, we have to enter as 'A' during runtime, as I was getting an error for using a* symbol.
Eg:  java Expense_Eight_Puzzle_Problem.java start.txt goal.txt A true

Procedure to Execute:

1. Open the Terminal and change the current directory to my folder sxm6338_assmt1
2. You can see the start.txt and goal.txt files present in the directory
3. We have to compile the java code by using the following command

		javac Expense_Eight_Puzzle_Problem.java

5. Now we have to pass the arguments and with the preferred algorithm to execute.
	
		java Expense_Eight_Puzzle_Problem.java start.txt goal.txt A true

6. Repeat the step 5 for different algorithms 

7. We see the outputs in the terminal and the trace files are also generated in the directory.
